# Source Citation Style

Use this format for all non-trivial rules, algorithms, and docstrings. Prefer
release-pinned resources from `openehr_am_resources.md`.

```
Sources:
- [RESOURCE_ID] Title, version/date. Section: X.Y / clause Z. Link/path: <URL or local path>
  Note: <1–3 sentence paraphrase of what this code implements>
```

Guidelines:
- Use resource IDs from `openehr_am_resources.md` (e.g., `AM-ADL2-2.3.0`).
- Keep notes short; paraphrase instead of quoting.
- If the exact clause is unknown, provide best-effort and add `TODO` to refine.
- Prefer release URLs over `/latest/`; align with `SPEC_BASELINE.md`.
