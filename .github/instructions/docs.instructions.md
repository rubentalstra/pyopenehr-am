# Documentation standards

- Be concise and practical; prefer steps and examples.
- Use consistent terms: ADL2, AOM2, ODIN, BMM, OPT2.
- Link to official spec URLs when describing standards behavior.
- Avoid copying large blocks of spec text; summarize in your own words.
- For public API docs, include a minimal working snippet.
