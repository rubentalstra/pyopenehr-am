# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination
- Insults, derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action.

## Reporting

To report unacceptable behavior, please open an issue in this repository. If you
believe reporting publicly may put you at risk, contact the maintainers via a
private channel if one is available.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1.
