# OPT compilation

## Goal

Compile an ADL template + referenced archetypes into an Operational Template
(OPT2) that can be used for runtime validation.

## MVP scope (recommended)

- Resolve archetype dependencies
- Basic slot filling
- Deterministic JSON export
- Integrity checks (no broken references)

## Future scope

- Full specialization flattening
- Full template overlay rules
- Instance validation against OPT
